# Video Game Logger

## Overview
My girlfriend's nephew introduced me to the huge library of video games that are available with Xbox Game Pass. I wanted to make a simple program that would help me keep track of the games I have played or might want to play. This program allows a user to create a list of game titles, view the list of games, and export the list of games to a CSV file. The program also displays a countdown by number of days left until a certain game is released. (Currently Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart)

## Features
1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
2. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
3. Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file.
4. Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
5. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application. (The application doesn't actual read data from an external file, but rather the opposite. It exports data to an external file.)
